          <ol>
            <li>
              We admitted we were powerless over alcoholâ€”that our lives had become unmanageable.
            </li>
            <li>Came to believe that a Power greater than ourselves could restore us to sanity.</li>
            <li>
              Made a decision to turn our will and our lives over to the care of God as we
              understood Him.
            </li>
            <li>Made a searching and fearless moral inventory of ourselves.</li>
            <li>
              Admitted to God, to ourselves, and to another human being the exact nature of our
              wrongs.
            </li>
            <li>Were entirely ready to have God remove all these defects of character.</li>
            <li>
              Made a list of all persons we had harmed, and became willing to make amends to them
              all.
            </li>
            <li>Humbly asked Him to remove our shortcomings.</li>
            <li>
              Made direct amends to such people wherever possible, except when to do so would injure
              them or others.
            </li>
            <li>
              Continued to take personal inventory and when we were wrong promptly admitted it.
            </li>
            <li>
              Sought through prayer and meditation to improve our conscious contact with God, as we
              understood Him, praying only for knowledge of His will for us and the power to carry
              that out.
            </li>
            <li>
              Having had a spiritual awakening as the result of these Steps, we tried to carry this
              message to alcoholics, and to practice these principles in all our affairs.

          <ul>
            <li>
              The Big Book lays out the 12 steps of Alcoholics Anonymous and includes personal
              stories of those who found recovery in the program.
            </li>
            <li>
              Many recovering alcoholics work the 12 steps with a sponsor. The process includes
              believing in a power greater than yourself, admitting past mistakes, making amends to
              people you have harmed through alcoholism and continuing to focus on spiritual growth.
