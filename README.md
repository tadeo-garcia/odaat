# One Day At A Time

One Day At A Time is an original social media app that is catered towards members of Alcoholics Anonymous. Users can host or browse meetings, official and non-official, through a Google Maps integrated API. It also has the functionality of other traditional social media apps, like customizing your profile picture or banner, and following other users.
